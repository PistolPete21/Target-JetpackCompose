# Target-JetpackCompose

## Installation
Clone the repository and import into Android Studio Preview - Artic Fox Canary 11

## Description
This project uses the brand new Jetpack Compose library that Android has to offer. The project makes use of all the apis in Compose, as well as some nice third party libraries like Retrofit and Glide. This project pulls data from a fake "Deals" api and posts it to the composable screen. The app fetches data by launching a Couroutine then requests the data via Retrofit and sends it back to the composable screen.

## Libraries
This project utilizes: **Compose,** **Retrofit,**, ** **Glide,** and **MaterialThemeing.**
